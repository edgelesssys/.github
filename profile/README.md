**What is Confidential Computing?**

* With it, cloud workloads become end-to-end secure and end-to-end verifiable.</li>
* We have built easy-to-use, open-source tools that get you started in no time, check them out below.</li>
* Check out our [whitepaper](https://content.edgeless.systems/hubfs/Confidential%20Computing%20Whitepaper.pdf) or visit our friends at the [Confidential Computing Consortium](https://confidentialcomputing.io) to find out more about all things confidential computing.
